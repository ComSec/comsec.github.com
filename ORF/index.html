                The <a href="http://www.mri.gov.on.ca/english/programs/orf/re/program.asp" target="_blank">Ontario Research Fund Research Excellence (ORF-RE)</a> program promotes research excellence in Ontario by supporting transformative, internationally significant research of strategic value to the province. The ORF-RE focuses on scientific excellence and strong commercialization and targets new, leading-edge research initiatives.

                </p>
                <p>The  emerging technology of ad hoc communication and embedded systems, including the  range from mobile ad hoc network, vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), wireless  sensor network (WSN), and cognitive radio systems to mobile phones, digital  audio players, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, Global Positioning  System (GPS), and interactive whiteboards, increasingly permeates everyone’s life.  </p>
                <p>Mobile  ad hoc communication and embedded systems have a wide range of applications,  ranging from  emergency response  operation, military or police networks, disaster relief operations, tele-conferences,  and safety-critical business operations to supply chain management, library  systems, e-passports, contactless cards (e.g., proximity cards, automated  toll-payment   transponders, and payment tokens), identification systems, and human  implantation (such as medical-record indexing, and physical access control). Future  applications could include smart appliances, shopping, medication compliance  monitoring, and RFID embedded body sensors.  </p>
                <p>Ad  hoc communication and embedded systems are those of the most promising  technologies in the field of ubiquitous and pervasive computing. Many new  applications can be created by embedding an object with RFID tags. However, the  rapid development of mobile ad hoc communication and embedded systems raises  serious privacy and security concerns to which the current security  technologies cannot provide any satisfactory solutions. </p>
The proposed research project is to investigate design, implementation,  testing, and performance analysis of novel security solutions for emerging  mobile ad hoc communication and embedded systems, with emphasis on privacy  protection and authentication mechanisms.          </div>
